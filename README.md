# Belt

No dependencies, or yes dependencies, but no transitive ones. Keep it stable & simple. Consistent naming. Can take the occasion to rework/rename some Js.* APIs.

Also use this repo as a guidance repo, e.g. have dummy AsyncSolution.re module with the content being let notImplementedStayTunedReadThisURL = "https://..."

Again, keep it simple. Might need to upstream these to BS later, or be imported and tested internally.
